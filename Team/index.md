"The MicroFEWS project is a unique opportunity to quantify the effects of current and future renewable energy generation on measurable food and water outcomes in Alaska communities.  I'm excited to be working with these communities and to hear their input and feedback on these connections."

"Past experiences have shown that proper integration of renewable energy systems in remote Alaska communities is critical for maintaining reliable electricity and heat which translates to reliable food and water systems. Using energy as a lens in this project we hope to better understand and predict how renewable energy would impact food, energy, and water security in these remote communities."

"Food, Energy, and Water are inextricably linked and it is about time we look at the system holistically than just trying to tackle the parts. I am excited to explore this uncharted territory with a diverse team of Alaskan community members, researchers, and beyond."

"Speaking as somebody who focused on water in school, this idea of looking at food, water, and energy as an integrated system is an exciting concept. I think this approach makes a lot of sense for rural Alaska, and I look forward to hearing what rural Alaska has to say about it."
