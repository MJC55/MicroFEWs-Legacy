# Objective 5: MicroFEWs Synthesis

## Lead
Bill Schnabel <br/>
weschnabel@alaska.edu

## Research Question
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
What are the feedbacks between the on-grid infrastructure components described in <a href="https://mjc55.github.io/MicroFEWs_Legacy/Objectives/Objective_4">Objective 4</a>, and the off-grid drivers of the local FEW nexus?
</div>
 


| Goal | Status |
| ---  | ---  |
|  <img width=700/>  |  <img width=100/>  |
| Evaluate effects of the models (i.e. scenarios) from <a href="https://mjc55.github.io/MicroFEWs_Legacy/Objectives/Objective_4">Objective 4</a> on FEW metrics	| In&nbsp;Progress |
| In the Decision Theater North (DTN), present to the stakeholder advisory board members the scenarios with effects on FEW metrics	| Deferred&nbsp;(COVID) |
| Hold subsequent meetings to refine scenarios	| Deferred (COVID) |
| Characterize differences between modeling processes/outcomes at the three communities to address MicroFEWs scalability	| Completed |
| Share results with the broader scientific community nationally and globally through journals and presentations in technical, trade, and policy forums, and outreach to related organizations	| Completed |
