# Objective 4: Novel Energy Distribution Models

## Lead
Richard Wies

## Research Question
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
How can renewable energy and FEW-related infrastructure loads be modeled to optimally manage the variable energy demands associated with production of place-based food, 
energy, and water requirements, but also to enhance grid stability?
  <br> <br>
We will develop Energy Distribution Models for each community to optimize the control of renewable energy generation to dispatchable loads in the MicroFEWs system and 
test these control strategies in a full-scale microgrid laboratory.
