# Objective 3: Modular Systems Case Studies

## Research Question
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
How can new technologies not currently deployed in renewable-hybrid grids be evaluated for their potential to influence FEW security?
  <br> <br>
Electrical resistance heaters are commonly employed to dispatch excess electricity produced by intermittent renewable sources. 
However, other dispatchable loads may impact the FEW nexus in ways that better address a particular communityâ€™s needs. For this Objective, 
we evaluate three different modular FEW-related systems for their potential to serve as dispatchable loads in renewable-hybrid microgrids.
</div>
 
## Purpose
 
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
The purpose is not only to characterize the function of systems themselves, but also to develop the capacity of MicroFEWs to integrate new 
technologies into the modelling process.
