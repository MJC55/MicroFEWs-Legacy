Renewable Energy Infographics Developed for Rural Alaska

There is great interest in renewable energy by rural Alaska residents and in turn there is the need for information.  As part of the MicroFEWs project, researchers traveled to four communities in rural Alaska (Cordova, Igiugig, Kongiganak, and Tanana) where residents expressed interest in having infographics made to help them better understand different types of renewable energy and in turn make more informed decisions for themselves and their community.  Infographics are graphic visual representations of information that provide information quickly and clearly.  Using community feedback, we produced three infographics based on solar photovoltaic, hydro-electric, and wind energy.

  COVID-19 halted our field work, but our team has been hard at work analyzing and writing up results.  Here's a [recent reflection](https://sustainabilitycommunity.springernature.com/posts/how-we-lost-our-naivete-and-regained-our-optimism-about-the-food-energy-water-nexus?channel_id=behind-the-paper) from Dr. Henry Huntington following [our publication in Nature Sustainability](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-021-00719-1). Look for more published work and reflections in the coming months.
