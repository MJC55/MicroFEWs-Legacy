# Kongiganak

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Kongiganak, AK (population 650) is a primarily Yup’ik Eskimo village situated on the Kongiganak River, near Kuskokwim Bay in southwest Alaska.
<br>
<br>
The community’s microgrid is powered by two 200 kW diesel generators, at a cost of ~60 cents/kW to residents. Heating fuel costs about $5/gallon and consumes 
about half of household income. In 2010, five 95 kW wind turbines were installed in this often windy community to harness the wind resource and to reduce the 
fuel consumed for electricity generation. The installation was part of the Chaninik Wind Group formed by neighboring tribal governments in Kongiganak, Kwigilliingok, 
Tuntutuliak, and Kipnuk after realizing that working together was the only way to survive the increasing fuel costs. Twenty ceramic thermal electric stoves were also 
installed in community residences to use electricity from excess wind generation and reduce heating fuel costs. The wind turbines offset up to 30 – 40% of the diesel 
required to meet the community’s base electric load, and the thermal stoves have made a barrel of heating fuel last up to six weeks instead of two. The community 
attempted to install running water to all homes a few years ago. However, the project was never realized as logistics issues meant digging the pipes under the tundra 
and risking them freezing by the permafrost. The community members still collect their water from a Village Safe Water treatment plant in barrels, and frugal use of 
water in the home is employed.

# Tanana

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Tanana, Alaska, USA (population 308) is a primarily Athabaskan community located near the confluence of the Tanana and Yukon Rivers in Interior Alaska.
<br>
  <br>
The Tanana microgrid is powered by a diesel generator, and the community has a single water treatment plant/laundromat (washeteria) that serves as a distribution 
point for drinking water.The community lacks public water and wastewater distribution lines.While there is no permanent road access, the State of Alaska recently 
constructed a gravel road terminating approximately 5 miles east of town on the opposite side of the Yukon River. Thus, residents have wintertime road access over 
the frozen river, and rely on barge and air freight in the warm season.
<br>
  <br>
In November 2007, Tanana installed two 425,000 Btu/hour cordwood-fired biomass boilers in its city washeteria. That project has reduced oil consumption in the 
washeteria by approximately 50%. Since then, the biomass program has expanded to three biomass-fired boilers in the washeteria, one in the fire station, four 
in the school, one in the city workshop, four in public housing, and two more newly installed in a triplex and a greenhouse. Due to the success of the biomass 
program, city manager Jeff Weltzin has expressed interest in our proposed work, and seeks to explore with us the broader ramifications of bringing other forms 
of renewable energy to his community.
